Class project for COMS 4762: Machine Learning for Functional Genomics

Uses an Exchangeable Neural Network (more information found from T. Ahn et al., "Deep Learning-based Identification of Cancer or Normal Tissue using Gene Expression Data," 2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), 2018, pp. 1748-1752, doi: 10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621108)

Inputs are single-cell gene expression matrices from the Cancer Single-Cell Expression Map database. Labels of cancer type included in data.

Multi-class classification of data into six different cancer types: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), colon cancer (CRC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)
